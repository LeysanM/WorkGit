Simple structure is the sole proprietorship, that usually involves just one individual who owns and operates the enterprise. With a sole proprietorship, your business earnings are taxed only once, unlike other business structures. Another big plus is that you will have complete control over your businessâ€“you make all the decisions. However, there are a few disadvantages to consider. Selecting the sole proprietorship business structure means that you are personally responsible for your company's liabilities. Raising money for a sole proprietorship can also be difficult. Banks not often make business loans to sole proprietorships. In most cases, you will have to depend on your savings or family loans.
